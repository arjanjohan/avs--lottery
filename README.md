</h4>

üîß An open-source, up-to-date toolkit for building your own Eigenlayer AVS. This repository is designed to make it easier for any developer to create and deploy AVS smart contracts and build user interfaces that interact with those AVS contracts. This repository includes the [Hello World AVS](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/hello-world-avs) contracts and a frontend dashboard to interact with this AVS.

‚öôÔ∏è Built using Eigenlayer, NextJS, RainbowKit, Foundry, Wagmi, Viem, and Typescript.

- ‚úÖ **Contract Hot Reload**: The frontend auto-adapts to your smart contract as you edit it.
- ü™ù **[Custom hooks](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/hooks/)**: Collection of React hooks wrapper around [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) to simplify interactions with smart contracts with typescript autocompletion.
- üß± [**Components**](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/components/): Collection of common web3 components to quickly build your frontend.
- üî• **Burner Wallet & Local Faucet**: Quickly test your application with a burner wallet and local faucet.
- üîê **Integration with Wallet Providers**: Connect to different wallet providers and interact with the Ethereum network.

## Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (>= v18.17)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Quickstart

To get started with Scaffold-AVS, follow the steps below:

1. Install dependencies if it was skipped in CLI:

```
cd scaffold-avs
yarn install
```

2. Make sure Docker is running

3. Run a local network in the first terminal:
<!-- TODO: make a yarn command for this -->

```
make start-chain-with-contracts-deployed
```

This command starts a local Ethereum network using Foundry. The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development. You can customize the network configuration in `packages/foundry/foundry.toml`.

4. On a second terminal, deploy the test contracts:

```
yarn deploy
```

This command deploys a test smart contract to the local network. The contract is located in `packages/foundry/contracts` and can be modified to suit your needs. The `yarn deploy` command uses the deploy script located in `packages/foundry/script` to deploy the contract to the network. You can also customize the deploy script.

5. On a third terminal, start your NextJS app:

```
yarn start
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contract using the `Debug Contracts` page. You can tweak the app config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.

6. Sign in as the operator and register with EigenLayer and AVS on the frontend. Now you can create tasks (using any wallet) and respond to them (with a wallet registered as operator).

Run smart contract test with `yarn foundry:test`

- Edit your smart contract `HelloWorldServiceManager.sol` in `packages/foundry/contracts`
- Edit your frontend homepage at `packages/nextjs/app/page.tsx`. For guidance on [routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/defining-routes) and configuring [pages/layouts](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts) checkout the Next.js documentation.
- Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/foundry/script`

## Next steps

This project is still in progress, and here is a list of tasks I need to complete:

- Fix makefile or replace by other scripts:
  - start-chain-with-contracts-deployed
  - start-operator
  - spam-tasks
- Fix EventListenerComponent (invalid hook call for loading status)
- Fix Signature errors (Register with AVS and Respond to task)
- Add auto respond to task feature
- Migrate project to hardhat

Contributions to the project are welcome.
